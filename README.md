# What to accomplish
1) has tests
2) basic auth flow

6) basic dashboard screen display user information
7) basic settings screen to modify user profile.
8) built in responsiveness
9) built in flavors (dev,staging,prod)


# Top TODOs
1) setup login flow
2) make api call using dio and cache response using dio cacher
3) Use auto route for navigtion
4) setup guards for users that are not auth'ed


# DONE
1) full test suite running in github actions
2) logging with sentry monitoring
3) riverpod
4) Flavors configured

## Getting Started ðŸš€

### First step
Run `dart pub global activate derry`
This will allow you to run commands defined in derry.yaml like `derry lint`
Support for running integration tests with flavors is added
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/89045
If you are on master you can run `derry test_all` or `derry e2e_iphone`

To run unit tests `derry unit_test`

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Flutter Template works on iOS, Android, and Web._

## Running Tests ðŸ§ª

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ derry test_all
$ derry e2e
$ derry unit
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
